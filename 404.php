      <p>Sorry, I know this isn't what you were hoping to see. The page you were looking for is probably gone, but you can try searching for it just to make sure:</p>
      <p><?php get_search_form(); ?></p>
      <p>If that doesn't work, maybe you can find something else on the <a href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>">front page</a>.</p>
